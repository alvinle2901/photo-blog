## Steps to reproduce:

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alvinle2901/photo-blog.git
```

### Pre-requirements

#### DB

I used [Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/) for your database. It's free and easy to setup. Once you have your database setup, you will need to add the connection string to your `.env.local` file.

```.env.local
AUTH_DRIZZLE_URL="postgres://"
POSTGRES_URL="postgres://"
```

Generate the migration

```sh
bun run db:generate
```

Run the migrations

```sh
bun run db:migrate
```

#### Init User

Add env variables

```.env.local
USER_EMAIL=
USERNAME=
USER_PASSWORD=
```

```sh
bun run db:seed
```

#### Mapbox

To get a Mapbox token, you will need to register on [their website](https://www.mapbox.com/). The token will be used to identify you and start serving up map tiles. The service is free until a certain level of traffic is exceeded.

```.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### ESLint and Prettier fix

```shell
npm run format
```

### Start the app

```shell
npm run dev
```
